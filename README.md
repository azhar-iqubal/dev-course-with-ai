   - **Auto-run**: Enable
   - **Auto-fix Errors**: Enable

### Step 5: Configure the AI Instructor

Copy the entire contents of `INSTRUCTOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and paste it into the **Advanced Options** prompt field in your custom agent mode. This file contains detailed instructions for the AI instructor on how to:

- Deliver hands-on, practical lessons
- Create exercises on-the-fly
- Debug collaboratively with you
- Track progress and provide feedback
- Use Bun as the preferred package manager
- Follow a structured session flow

### Step 6: Start Learning
